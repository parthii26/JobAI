🛠️ Step-by-Step Prompt-Style Implementation Plan
1. 🔐 Firebase Authentication
Prompt:

Implement Firebase Authentication using Email/Password login. Once authenticated, store the user UID in Firestore under a users collection along with name and email.

2. 📤 Resume Upload (Frontend)
Prompt:

Create a React component that allows users to upload .pdf, .doc, or .docx resumes. Use FormData to send the file to a Node.js/Flask backend. Display a progress bar and success/failure toast messages.

3. 📄 Resume Processing (Backend)
Prompt:

On file upload:

Extract text from the resume using pdfplumber or python-docx.

Extract relevant skills using a pre-trained BERT model.

Calculate resume score based on skill relevance, formatting, keyword match, etc.

Store resume data in Firestore under resumes/{userId}/documents.

4. 🧠 Skill Extraction
Prompt:

Extract both technical and soft skills using keyword mapping and NER models (BERT/Spacy). Store extracted skills under the resume document in Firestore.

5. 📊 Resume Scoring
Prompt:

Implement a scoring engine that gives:

Overall score

Skill match %

Format quality

Keyword density
Save the scores to Firestore in the resume document.

6. ❓ Interview Question Generator
Prompt:

Based on extracted skills, generate personalized interview questions using GPT-3.5 or GPT-Neo. Save them to interview_questions/{userId}/questions in Firestore.

7. 📈 Dashboard UI
Prompt:

Build a dashboard that shows:

Number of resumes uploaded

Skills identified

Average match score

Questions generated
Fetch this data from Firestore using React Query.

8. 🧩 Resume Management Page
Prompt:

Create a page that lists all resumes uploaded by the user. Allow viewing:

Parsed text

Skill list

Score breakdown

Download option

9. 🔎 Job Role Matcher + Skill Gap Analyzer (New Feature)
Prompt:

Create a collection job_roles in Firestore with job titles and required skills.

For a user's uploaded resume:

Match the resume's extracted skills against each job role.

Compute a similarity percentage.

Identify missing skills as “Skill Gaps”.
Save the output in recommendations/{userId}/matches.

10. 💡 Skill Gap Learning Suggestions (Bonus)
Prompt:

Use the skill gaps to recommend:

YouTube tutorials

Free courses (Coursera/edX API or static links)

Practice questions
Store recommendations per user.
